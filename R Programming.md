# Module 7: Programming in R

We've already covered basic for loops in R. In this walkthrough, we'll cover functions and conditional statements

In this video, we will use data from my own lab to learn how to do programming constructs in R. We've already covered for-loops in an earlier video, so in this one we'll cover the following:

* functions
* if-else statements
