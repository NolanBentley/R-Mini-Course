# R-Mini-Course
In this mini course, we will explore the programming language and environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/). We will integrate R with command line towards the end of this course to show you how to use R within shell scripts and execute R code via an HPC, using the Alabama Super Computer as an example.

To use R, we will be mainly working within the GUI environment of RStudio. Although R can be run and loaded from the command line, RStudio includes a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R, such as a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. This is also known as an IDE or integrated development environment. 

The content is meant to be self-guided, with several walk through tutorial videos, as well as exercises to practice on your own. 

## Topics

* [Getting Started in the R and RStudio Environment](https://github.com/StevisonLab/R-Mini-Course/blob/main/Setting%20up%20your%20environment.md)
  * Activity #1: Plotting Coverage Along a chromosome 
* [Basic Summary Statistics in R](https://github.com/StevisonLab/R-Mini-Course/blob/main/4.02.Basic_Summary_Statistics_in_R.Rmd)
* Data manipulation in R
* Advanced Graphing in R
  * Activity #2: Practice Graphing in R
* Advanced Statistical Concepts in R
* Using R on the Command Line
* Programming in R
  * Activity #3: R on a supercomputer - building a pipeline script


### Learning Objectives
* Practice the art of reproducibility using R scripts 
* Become comfortable in the RStudio working environment
* Learn how to conduct basic summary statistics in R
* Learn how to manipulate files in R
* Learn how to perform basic statistical tests in R
* Learn how to use programming constructs in R (e.g. loops, conditionals, etc.)
* Learn how to use R on the command line

### Materials and Resources

We have found two great R tutorials. There are SO many out there, that we just couldn't decide, so we have provided you with two options - one that you would need to download and can do within RStudio on your computer. Alternatively, you can complete the web-based one we were able to find. EITHER should be sufficient to get you started with the basics.

* [R Cheatsheet](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf)

* R tutorials:

 * Downloadable via swirl:
   * Install the swirl package: https://swirlstats.com/students.html (Links to an external site.)
   * Run "swirl::install_course("The R Programming Environment")" on the R console
   * Then launch swirl with the command "swirl()".

### Suggested Reading

A great companion text for learning R that we recomend is the book [R in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action). Suggested reading will be provided for each topic.

Optional: Alternative to R in Action are several FREE R Textbooks. Two that we like are:
* [YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)  
* [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)
